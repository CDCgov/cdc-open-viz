# View Component
A special component that renders a layout based on the current view for the user. The view is changed, depending on the consumption of the component, or the current URL of the user:
- If a COVE component is loaded on its own, the view will be set to `component`. In this mode, the component displays as normal, and no interactive options are available. This is the default view.
- If the URL contains `?editor=true`, the view will be set to `editor`. In this mode, the EditorPanels for an individual component will be accessible, and a special interactive screen is available for previewing the component with breakpoints.
- When accessing a component through the Wizard, the view is set to `wizard`. In this mode, the EditorPanels and interactive breakpoint previews are available, regardless of the URL parameters.
