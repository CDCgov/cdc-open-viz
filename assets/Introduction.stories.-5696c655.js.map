These components are used to power visualizations across cdc.gov and its affiliated projects, but are available for use by anyone.\\n\\n| Package | Docs | Description |\\n|--|---|---|\\n| [@cdc/map](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/map) | [CdcMap](https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/) | React component for visualizing tabular data on a map of the United States or the world. |\\n| [@cdc/chart](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/chart) | [CdcChart](https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/) | React component for visualizing data with a chart. |\\n| [@cdc/editor](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/editor) | [CdcEditor](https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/) | React component for importing data and creating a map or chart configuration. |\\n| [@cdc/dashboard](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/dashboard) | [CdcDashboard](https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/) | React component to build and display multiple data visualizations. |\\n| [@cdc/data-bite](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/data-bite) | [CdcDataBite](https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/) | React component for bringing attention to and visualizing a smaller data point. |\\n| [@cdc/markup-include](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/markup-include) | [CdcMarkupInclude](https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/) | React component for importing HTML markup data from a separate source link. |\\n| [@cdc/waffle-chart](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/waffle-chart) | [CdcWaffleChart](https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/) | React component for displaying a percentage value on a filled grid chart, aka \\\"waffle chart\\\". |\\n\\n## Documentation <a name=\\\"setup\\\"></a>\\n[https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/](https://cdcgov.github.io/cdc-open-viz/) - Documentation for COVE visualizations, components, and tooling.\\n\\n## Setup <a name=\\\"setup\\\"></a>\\n\\nThis repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that is managed with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#readme).\\n\\nAll packages use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management; it must be installed before beginning. To install yarn, run the following command (requires [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)):\\n\\n```\\nnpm install --global yarn\\n```\\n\\nTo work on individual packages, you must set up the entire monorepo.\\n\\n1. Start by cloning this repo and running `yarn install` at the root.\\n2. Run `lerna bootstrap` and Lerna will initialize all subrepository packages for you.\\n3. Run `lerna run build` to build all packages in the correct order.\\n4. To begin working on an individual package, run `lerna run --scope @cdc/package_name start`, replacing `package_name` with the package's name (ex: `@cdc/map`).\\n\\n> **[Known Issues]**\\n>\\n> There is a problem when importing `react-table` on Windows environments. This will be addressed in a later release.\\n>\\n> **Temporary Fix:** Change the import from `react-table` to `react-table/src` in the `<DataTable/>` component for the following pacakges:\\n> - Map\\n> - Chart\\n> - Editor\\n> - Dashboard\\n\\n## Development Guidelines\\n\\n**Please read!** These are important to know before you begin working on this project.\\n\\n### Package Imports\\nEach package is designed to be imported as a module by another project:\\n  * This might be different from React projects you are used to working on, that build bundle files that can be included directly on HTML pages.\\n  * We don't include `react` or `react-dom` as dependencies in any package; these are listed as `peerDependencies` instead.\\n  * We avoid adding any CDC specific functionality (ex. metrics calls) or logos in these packages.\\n\\n### Tooling/Configuration\\nTooling/Configuration is shared as much as possible among packages. These shared elements are stored in the root of this repository.\\nThis ensures that if something breaks in our tooling, we only need to fix it in one spot. It also helps ensure consistency across packages.\\n**Please do not break this guideline.** It is critical for allowing a small team to maintain this project effectively.\\n\\n  * Code Linting configuration (ESLint/Lint Staged)\\n  * Build process (Vite)\\n\\n### Versioning\\nEach package has its own version number. Sometimes we need to make fixes or add features to a specific package for our day-to-day operations at cdc.gov, which lends itself to different version numbers for each package.\\n\\n### Creating A Package\\nHere are some tips and guidelines for creating a new package:\\n  * When creating a new package, use lowercase or lower-kebab-case for the folder name; do not append any sort of prefix.\\n  * The name of the package in `package.json` should be scoped with `@cdc/`.\\n    * Example: If you're creating a new package named `foo`, the folder path would be `packages/foo` and the package name would be `@cdc/foo`.\\n  * You can't just create the folder inside `/packages/`. Lerna has specific commands to add new packages:\\n    * If you're starting from scratch, use [`lerna create`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lerna/create)\\n    * If you're importing a package that's already been created, use [`lerna import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lerna/import).\\n  * New packages should have their version start at 1.0.0 through development. Once published, follow the [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) for subsequent releases.\\n  * Respect the guidelines above, and ask someone if you're unsure of something.
