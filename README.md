# CDC OpenViz

CDC OpenViz is a collection of React components and related packages centered around data visualization. These components are used to power visualizations across cdc.gov and affiliated projects.

This project is still under heavy initial development with the roadmap extending into late 2022.

| Package | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [@cdc/map](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/map) | React component for visualizing tabular data on a map of the United States or the world. |
| [@cdc/chart](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/chart) | React component for visualizing data with a chart. |
| [@cdc/editor](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/editor) | React component for importing data and creating a map or chart configuration. |
| [@cdc/dashboard](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/dashboard) | React component to build and display multiple data visualizations. |
| [@cdc/data-bite](https://github.com/CDCgov/cdc-open-viz/tree/main/packages/data-bite) | React component for bringing attention to and visualizing a smaller data point. |

## Setup <a name="setup"></a>

This repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) that is managed with [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#readme) and uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. Make sure you have yarn installed before beginning. To work on individual packages you must setup the entire monorepo.

1. Start by cloning this repo and running `yarn install` at the root. 
2. Run `lerna bootstrap` and Lerna will initialize all the packages for you.
3. (If using Windows) Change the import from 'react-table' to 'react-table/src' in the DataTable component of these pacakges: Map, Chart, Editor, Dashboard (TODO: fix this)
4. Run `lerna run build` to build all of the packages in the correct order.
5. To begin working on an individual package, run `lerna run --scope @cdc/package_name start`, replacing `package_name` with the package's name (ex: `@cdc/map`).

## Development Guidelines

**Please read!** These are important to know before you begin working on this project.

### Each package is designed to be imported as a module by another project.
  * This might be different from React projects you are used to working on, that build bundle files that can be included directly on HTML pages.
  * We don't include `react` or `react-dom` as dependencies in any package, since every project that would import these will have them. These are listed as `peerDependencies`.
  * We avoid adding any CDC specific functionality (ex. metrics calls) or logos in these packages, that should go in our wrapper codebase.

This pattern of packages being imported by another project is implemented internally at CDC. We have a wrapper codebase that imports these packages. The bundle generated from that wrapper is then served on pages.

### Tooling/Configuration is shared as much as possible among packages.
These shared elements are stored in the root of this repository. This ensures that if something breaks in our tooling, we only need to fix it in one spot. It also helps ensure consistency across packages. **Please do not break this guideline.** It is critical to allowing a small team to maintain this project effectively.

  * Code Linting configuration (ESLint/Lint Staged)
  * Build process (Webpack)

### Each package has its own version number.

Sometimes we need to make fixes or add features to a specific package for our day to day work at cdc.gov which lends itself to different version numbers for each package.

### Tips for creating a new package.
  * When creating a new package, use lowercase for the folder name and don't use any kind of prefix.
  * The name of the package in `package.json` should be scoped with `@cdc/`. So if you're creating a new package called Foo, the folder path to it would be `packages/foo` and the package name would be `@cdc/foo`.
  * Lerna has specific commands to add packages - you can't just create the folder inside `/packages/`. If you're starting from scratch use [`lerna create`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lerna/create) and if you're importing a package that's already been created use [`lerna import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lerna/import).
  * New packages should have their version start at 1.0.0 through development until they are first published and follow [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) afterwards.
  * Respect the guidelines above and ask someone if you're unsure of something.
