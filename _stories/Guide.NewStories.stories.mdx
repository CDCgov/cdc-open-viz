# Adding New Stories

This library is organized flowing [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principals

**ensure that main.ts createEntries function includes that package where the story lives**

## Overview:

- Atoms: Smallest building block
- Molecules: created from Atoms
- Organisms: Made of Atoms and Molecules while still being a modular building block
- Templates: Can be use to make pages
- Pages: Largest building block which can be isolated from an application

## Should you create a new Story?:

1. Is the feature a new UI component which will be public facing?
2. Can the feature be categorized as an Atom, Molecule, Organism, Template, or Page?
3. Does the feature need to be regression/smoke tested by other developers before PRs?
4. Does the story open directly to the state you wish to show without the need for user interaction?

_If the answer to any of the above is true consider adding a story. If you are considering building or have built a new story and you can't answer yes to any of the above then the story is probably not needed_
