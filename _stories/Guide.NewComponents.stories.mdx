# Adding New Components

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new component.
<br/>

## Naming Conventions
- Because the components are imported directly from COVE related files, there is no need to reference `COVE` in the component name. For example, `CoveButton` should just be named `Button`.
- Components should be named in PascalCase, and should be named after the component itself. For example, a component that renders a button should be named `Button`, not `ButtonComponent`.
- Subcomponents should include the name of the parent component, then list its variation, subvariation, etc. The file name should have variation separated by a period in the file name.

  For example:
  ```js
  Map.jsx -> Map.Marker.jsx -> Map.Marker.Icon.jsx
  ```
  &nbsp;
  ```js
  Map() -> MapMarker() -> MapMarkerIcon()
  ```
&nbsp;
## File Structure
All global components should be placed in its related `./packages/core/components/***` directory.

The `***` directory should be representative of the type of component being created:
  - `editor` - Components/subcomponents specific to the Editor view of a component, where visualization settings are set/modified.
  - `element` - Elements that are consumed for use in COVE, and can be recycled, but do not necessarily function as a direct part of the UI.
  - `hoc` - Components that are intended to be used as wrappers around other components. These usually provide higher, specific logic or functionality to a component/group of components.
  - `input` - Components that are intended to be used as inputs for Editor Panels, or - in rare cases - as inputs on visualizations.
  - `loader` - Components that are intended to be used as loaders for suspense/lazy loading of components.
  - `manager` - Components specifically intended to be used as tools for managing/interfacing with processed data, usually to interactively modify or manipulate data values or structure.
  - `ui` - Not to be confused with `element` - UI components are the most basic building blocks of an interface. These control the visual appearance of a component, and are usually the most reusable components in the system.

## Component Structure
All components should adhere loosely to the following format, using the comments to organize import uses and types:
```jsx
import React from 'react'

// Third Party
// Store
// Context
// Data
// Constants
// Hooks
// Helpers
// Components - Core
// Components - Local
// Styles

// Visualization
const Component = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Component</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
export default Component
```

While directly exporting a non-variable function does work, exporting functions this way allows for a cleaner method of attaching memoization, or adding extension optimizations to a component. It allows us to reference the exported const directly, vs wrapping the entire function itself (which can get lengthy, and cluttered with other function wrappers):

```jsx
export default memo(Component)
```
